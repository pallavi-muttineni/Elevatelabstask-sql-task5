SQL Joins Tutorial
Welcome to the SQL Joins Tutorial repository! This guide is designed to help you understand and practice the fundamental concepts of combining data from multiple tables using various SQL join types.

üéØ Objective
Our primary goal is to help you master the skill of merging data from different, related tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN clauses effectively.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Required
To get started and execute the SQL queries provided, you will need access to a SQL client or a database management tool. Here are some recommended options:

DB Browser for SQLite: A user-friendly, open-source tool perfect for working with SQLite databases.

MySQL Workbench: A powerful visual tool for MySQL database architects, developers, and administrators.

Any other SQL client compatible with standard SQL syntax (e.g., PostgreSQL's psql, SQL Server Management Studio, DBeaver).

üöÄ Setup and Execution
Follow these straightforward steps to set up your environment and run the queries:

Open Your SQL Tool: Launch your chosen SQL client (DB Browser for SQLite, MySQL Workbench, etc.).

Create a New Database/Schema (if applicable):

For tools like MySQL Workbench, you might need to create a new schema or database instance.

For DB Browser for SQLite, simply create a new database file.

Execute Table Creation and Data Insertion:

Locate the SQL code for "Step 1: Create Sample Tables and Insert Data" (typically found in a file like sql-joins-complete-code.sql within a GitHub repository).

Copy the entire section and paste it into your SQL client's query editor.

Execute the script. This will create the Customers and Orders tables and populate them with the necessary sample data.

Execute Join Queries:

Proceed to the sections containing the SQL queries for each join type (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN).

Copy and paste each query individually into your query editor.

Execute each query and carefully observe the results. Pay close attention to how each join type handles the inclusion or exclusion of rows based on matching and non-matching values.

üí° Note for SQLite Users: Please be aware that SQLite does not natively support RIGHT JOIN or FULL JOIN. Don't worry! Equivalent queries using LEFT JOIN and UNION ALL are provided within the SQL code comments to achieve the same results. Ensure you use these SQLite-specific versions when working with DB Browser for SQLite.

üìä Table Structure and Sample Data
This tutorial utilizes two simple, yet illustrative, tables to demonstrate the various join operations:

Customers Table
This table stores basic information about our customers.

Column Name

Data Type

Description

CustomerID

INT

Primary Key, unique identifier for each customer

Name

VARCHAR(100)

The full name of the customer

Email

VARCHAR(100)

The email address of the customer

Sample Data:

CustomerID

Name

Email

1

Alice

alice@example.com

2

Bob

bob@example.com

3

Charlie

charlie@example.com

4

David

david@example.com

Orders Table
This table records details about the orders placed by customers.

Column Name

Data Type

Description

OrderID

INT

Primary Key, unique identifier for each order

CustomerID

INT

Foreign Key, linking to Customers.CustomerID

OrderDate

DATE

The date the order was placed

Amount

DECIMAL(10, 2)

The total monetary amount of the order

‚ú® Join Types Covered
This tutorial provides practical examples and clear explanations for the following essential SQL join types:

INNER JOIN: Retrieves rows that have matching values in both tables. It's like finding the intersection of two sets.

LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the "left" table and the matching rows from the "right" table. If there's no match on the right, NULL values are returned for the right table's columns.

RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the "right" table and the matching rows from the "left" table. If there's no match on the left, NULL values are returned for the left table's columns.

FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows when there is a match in either of the tables. It combines the results of both a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN, showing all records from both tables and filling in NULLs where there are no matches.

‚úÖ Outcome
By diligently working through this tutorial, you will achieve a solid understanding of:

How to effectively create and relate tables in a SQL database.

The critical differences and use cases for INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL joins.

How to strategically choose the correct join type to fulfill specific data retrieval requirements.

The ability to write robust and efficient SQL queries for merging data across multiple tables.

Feel free to experiment further by modifying the sample data, adding more rows, or even creating additional related tables to deepen your understanding of SQL joins!
